# Esterox test task
A simple task for Esterox candidates.
 
 ---

There is a plus button, and clicking on it should open a modal which contains following these fields: `name input`, `Description Textarea` and `image uploading button`, after uploading an image the image should appear instead of the button.
After clicking on Save button it should append on the list, and clicking on the Trash icon it should be removed from list.

Here are balsamiqs of the mentioned above. Please notice that these images does not present the exact design but just the blueprint of it, so feel free to style how you prefer (maybe with modern UI trends).
